* Looking to better understand the tool chain and greenfield of a JVM(Kotlin/Java) application.

## Ways of working together
* I am not the strongest with spelling and grammar. I have a bit of dyslexia so words can be hard for me. If you see me type a word you may point it out, but let me find out how to spell it properly on my own. Thank you for giving me grace on this :)  
* I may seem like an extrovert however I am an introvert. I do need time to recharge my social battery. I will be vocal when I need a break.

## Teamwork preferences
* Meetings I like to use Zoom.

## Technical preferences
* JetBrains - Intellij

## Feedback preferences
I do best with 1-1 conversion for feedback, however, I am happy with any feedback that comes thru slack. Email is my least responsive mode of communication. If I am free, I do not mind an impromptu meeting to talk.
