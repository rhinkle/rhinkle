* Taking the con|ownership and delivering

## How to support me as a person
* I love feedback on how I can be a better human. My "door" is always open to giving feedback.
* Let me know if I could deliver messages more clear and concise
* There are some Java and more backend patterns that I am not proficient in.

## Ways of working together
* I am not the strongest with spelling and grammar. I have a bit of dyslexia so words can be hard for me. If you see me type a word you may point it out, but let me find out how to spell it properly on my own. 
* I may seem like an extrovert however I am an introvert. I do need time to recharge my social battery. I will be vocal when I need a break.

## Teamwork preferences
* Meetings I like to use Zoom.

## Technical preferences
* JetBrains - Intellij
* Frontend + API Integration > Just backend
* TypeScript > Javascript
* Kotlin > Java
* git for version control
* AWS
* CircleCi

## Feedback preferences
I do best with 1-1 conversion for feedback, however, I am happy with any feedback that comes thru slack. Email is my least responsive mode of communication. If I am free, I do not mind an impromptu meeting to talk.
