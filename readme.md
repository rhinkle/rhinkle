## Ways of working together

- I am not the strongest with spelling and grammar. I have a bit of dyslexia, so words can be challenging for me. If you see me type a word, you may point it out, but let me find out how to spell it correctly on my own. Thank you for giving me grace on this :)
- I may seem like an extrovert; however, I am an introvert. I do need time to recharge my social battery. I will be vocal when I need a break.

## Teamwork preferences

## Feedback preferences

I do best with 1-1 conversion for feedback; however, I am happy with any feedback that comes thru Slack. Email is my least responsive mode of communication. If I am free on my calendar, I do not mind an impromptu meeting to chat :smile:.
